    <p>One huge perk of hitting the gym is sweating out stress that may have built up during your day. Whether it's office politics or an annoying leak in the ceiling, exercise has the ability to distract, relieve, and re-focus your perspective.
        Sometimes changing up your usual yoga flow or running route is helpful, but other times an entirely new format of training is exactly what you need to lighten whatever stress you're feeling. Kickboxing, while not as common as Pilates, spin, or other popular fitness styles, is a fun, exciting way to spice up your sweat session—taking your stress out on a punching bag is a healthy way to work stress out of your system. You might even like it enough to incorporate the workout into your normal routine.

    <h1>Physical Benfits</h1>
</br>

    <p>Kickboxing can target many muscles, though it partially depends on what style of kickboxing you are doing. Cardio kickboxing is more cardio-intensive and focuses on your abs. Regular kickboxing is a martial art and can target muscles all over your body. Most commonly, kickboxing targets upper body strength.
        
        Due to the amount of cardio involved in kickboxing, it is excellent for improving your cardiovascular health. Your cardiovascular health refers to your heart and blood vessels. Having a healthy heart can help mitigate heart disease and other heart problems.

    <h1>Get the Right Kickboxing Gear</h1>
</br>
</br>


    <p>
        According to Dibernardo, most studios will require that you have hand wraps and boxing gloves. These are to protect your hands from injury. Of course, you should get a nice big water bottle, too. These are the basic requirements, though you should always talk to your instructor to determine any requirements for the types of equipment you need to buy. 
        
        Nelson elaborated further that you will want grippy sneakers and a hair tie if your hair is long. Safety gear can include:</p>
    </br>

        <ul>
            <li>Bag gloves</li>
            <li>Sparring gloves</li>
            <li>Mouthguard</li>
            <li>Headwear</li>
            <li>Shin guards</li>
        </ul>
